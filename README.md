# CSC786 Data Collection & Ethics Activity  
### Evaluating Linux EDR Syscall Monitoring and Evasion Techniques  
*Author: Michael Mendoza*  
*Date: October 2025*

This notebook demonstrates a **reproducible and ethical** data collection workflow for analyzing Linux EDR telemetry.  
Data are **synthetic** representations of syscall activity collected from a simulated Wazuh endpoint on RHEL.  
All code and data are safe for public sharing and do not include real system logs or personally identifiable information (PII).
